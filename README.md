## About

This repository contains lab exercises and courseworks for Topics 02 and 03 of COMP0130 Robot Vision and Navigation module for taught MSc students at UCL, delivered in Spring 2024. Exercises are designed to be attempted in the on-campus lab sessions on Monday afternoon, though you are free to do additional work in your own time if you wish.

Lab attendance will be monitored, but the exercises are not graded. You are welcome to discuss and help each other with these tasks and to ask for assistance and clarification from the TAs, but there is nothing to be gained by simply copying each others' work.

Topic 02 is implemented using pure Matlab and requires no installation instructions.

Topic 03 is implemented in C++ and requires some work to build and deploy the software. The instructions will be provided in a wiki which accompanies this page.

## Notes on usage

Note that because this repo is public, if you fork it, your fork will be public and this means your code would be visible for everybody. (Several people have forked previous versions of COMP0130 in previous years, but as far as we can tell these copy the code and do not include worked solutions.)

Also note that if you do a push request, this will be visible to ''everybody''. As a result, the repo will be archived except for brief periods when content is uploaded.
