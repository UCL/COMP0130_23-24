% Since we are doing just prediction, all the other sensors are disabled.
% This is the default setting.

% If you set this parameter to false, the simulator generates measurements
% with no noise in them. You might find this useful for debugging.
% However, unless specified otherwise, any submitted results must have this
% value set to true.

% Set up the simulator

% Create the localization system
drivebotSLAMSystem = drivebot.DriveBotSLAMSystem(configuration);

% This tells the SLAM system to do a very detailed check that the input
% appears to be correct but can make the code run slowly. Once you are
% confident your code is working safely, you can set this to false.
drivebotSLAMSystem.setValidateGraph(true);

% Run the main loop and correct results
results = minislam.mainLoop(simulator, drivebotSLAMSystem);

% Minimal output plots. These just show you an example of how to plot the
% results. For your report, you need to look at improving these figures
% including labelling axes, etc.
