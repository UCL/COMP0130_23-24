## About

This folder contains the materials for Topic 02.

The exercises are implemented in standard Matlab and do not require any special packages.

However, in the second workshop and for the coursework you will need to be able to use the matlab [`mex`](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mex.html) command.
